Experience
======
* Research Assistant - UIUC (August 2022 - Present)
  * RA in Professor Hanghang Tong’s IDEA Lab researching in Graph ML. Below are the projects I am working on:
    * Active Graph Anomaly Detection using Bi-Level Optimization by Ishika Agarwal, Qinghai Zhou and Hanghang Tong: We are exploring how to find anomalies in graph data using active learning, generative models and bi-level optimization. Given a graph with nodes, node attributes, edges and an oracle, we will try to learn a strong enough autoencoder that can learn the distinction between anomalous and benign nodes. Similar to real life, we do not have labels, but we have a human annotator who can make an educated guess for the label. From the human annotator, we will receive the label and their confidence (percentage) – we claim that we can use the soft label to learn highly accurate hard labels.
    * Neural Active Learning with Minimal Bandit Context Space by Yikun Ban, Ishika Agarwal, Hanghang Tong and Jingrui He: We aim to solve k-classification using active, multi-armed bandits. MAB agents can take a lot of space and time to perform k-classification (due to arm size/neural network size). However, by combining the dual exploitation-exploration structure of MAB’s and the computational efficiency of active learning, we can achieve better results than either method while keeping the running time low.
