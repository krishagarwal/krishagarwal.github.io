I am an undergrad Turing Scholar at UT Austin, graduating in May 2025. I'm working with [Dr. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/).

Research interests: I am interested in the intersection of systems and machine learning (ML). Specifically, I aim to write efficient implementations of existing ML algorithms for current hardware and design new algorithms/implementations that address hardware limitations by nature.

Highlights:
- [Summer 2024] Interned at IBM Research at Yorktown Heights. We published some of our work to the [PyTorch blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/hadacore/)! More detail on this work [here](http://krishagarwal.github.io/projects/hadacore).
