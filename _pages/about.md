I'm an incoming PhD student (starting Fall 2025) in [InfiniAI Lab](https://www.infini-ai-lab.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Beidi Chen](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/beidic/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and systems, including efficient implementations of existing ML algorithms for current hardware and the design of new algorithms/implementations that address hardware limitations by nature.

I completed my undergrad in CS at UT Austin, where I worked with [Dr. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) on integrating classical planning with large language models for long-term planning in service robots.

Highlights:
- [May 2024] I graduated from my undergrad at UT Austin, having successfully defended my [undergrad honors thesis](https://krishagarwal.github.io/projects/hadamard_fourier_masked_attn)!
- [Summer 2024] Interned at IBM Research at Yorktown Heights. We published some of our work to the [PyTorch blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/hadacore/)! More detail on this work [here](https://krishagarwal.github.io/projects/hadacore).
